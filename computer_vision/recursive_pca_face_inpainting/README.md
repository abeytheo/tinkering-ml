# Recursive PCA Face Inpainting

Given a masked image, the goal of the recursive PCA algorithm is to fill in the missing region with appropriate pixels retrieved from the eigenface space. In this project, I present three main topics:

- Basic face reconstruction using PCA
- PCA face reconstruction on RGB channel
- Face inpainting using recursive PCA
